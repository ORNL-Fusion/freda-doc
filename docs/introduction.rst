The Fusion REactor Design and Assessment (FREDA) Project
---------------

FREDA is a purpose-built framework for self-consistent, multi-fidelity, iterative optimization of next step fusion devices.
FREDA connects the fusion-plasma modeling to surrounding fusion-engineering components, incorporating the theory-based integrated plasma modeling suite **IPS-FASTRAN/CESOL** and the multiphysics simulation tools of Fusion Energy Reactor Models Integrator (**FERMI**). FREDA utilizes parametric geometry to enable automatic generation of detailed parametrized CAD.   


Mission and Scope
-----------------

FREDA's overarching goal is to connect plasma-materials-engineering
modeling in ways that reveal coupled sensitivities, tolerance
stack-ups, and system margins that would be invisible in traditional
serial design approaches. The project initially applies to tokamaks
and spherical tokamaks (STs), with potential future expansion to
stellarators.

The framework spans three key design phases:

* **Design Scoping** (lower fidelity): Large parameter space scans to identify promising design regions
* **Design Optimization** (medium fidelity): De-risking components and sub-systems through focused analysis
* **Digital Twin** (high fidelity): Full systems evaluation, pulse design, and operational scenario validation

Key Technical Capabilities
--------------------------

FREDA integrates three major modeling domains:

**Fusion-Plasma Physics** Built on the open-source Integrated Plasma
  Simulator (IPS) framework developed in the AToM SciDAC project,
  FREDA couples core, edge, and scrape-off layer (SOL) plasma physics
  codes including:
  
  * Core transport: FASTRAN, TGLF, NCLASS
  * Edge physics: EPED
  * SOL modeling: SOLPS-ITER, UEDGE, BOUT++/Hermes-3
  * Equilibrium: EFIT, FreeGS
  * Heating and current drive: NUBEAM, TORAY, GENRAY

**Parametric Geometry** A flexible geometry engine generates
  consistent representations across all physics domains, including
  systems codes, plasma equilibria, and detailed CAD models for
  engineering analysis. Two reactor class representations are
  currently available (FNSF-class and ARC-class) with automated
  transformation capabilities.

**Fusion-Engineering** Based on the Fusion Energy Reactor Models
  Integrator (FERMI), the engineering module integrates:
  
  * Neutronics and tritium breeding: MCNP, SHIFT
  * Thermal hydraulics: OpenFOAM
  * Structural mechanics: DIABLO, Elmer
  * Electromagnetics: Elmer, OpenFOAM
  * Computational fluid dynamics: OpenFOAM

Framework Architecture
----------------------

FREDA employs a component-based architecture with standardized data exchange through state files:

* **System State File**: Top-level coordination across all domains
* **Plasma State File**: Core and SOL plasma quantities
* **Geometry State File**: Parametric representations of all components
* **Engineering State File**: Neutronics, structural, thermal, electromagnetic, and CFD results

This architecture enables swappable modules with diverse CPU/GPU
requirements while maintaining data provenance and
reproducibility. The framework currently runs on NERSC's Perlmutter
supercomputer and prioritizes open-source tools wherever feasible.

Critical Physics Challenges
---------------------------

FREDA development is driven by specific fusion power plant (FPP) challenges that require integrated modeling:

**Impurities and "Slag" Management**
  Main wall erosion can dominate impurity influx during detached divertor operation. Solid plasma-facing components (PFCs) experience tons per year of net erosion and redeposition, with eroded material ("slag") potentially causing disruptions and retaining tritium. FREDA couples edge/SOL particle flux → neutral transport → plasma erosion and sputtering → redeposition patterns → tritium co-deposition, while thermal loads affect slag layer temperature → adhesion and exfoliation probability.

**PFC Material Lifetime and Operational Windows**
  Neutron damage, thermal fatigue, and irradiation transmutation narrow safe operational windows. FREDA must determine first wall armor thickness, replacement schedules, and allowable degradation by coupling: neutronics → transmutation → composition → property degradation (thermal conductivity κ, electrical conductivity σ, ductile-to-brittle transition temperature DBTT); thermal fatigue → irradiation creep → mechanical stress; and coolant choice → material corrosion and activation.

**Tritium Retention, Permeation, and Extraction**
  Low-Z materials co-deposit tritium while high-Z materials absorb or trap it through diffusion or bubble formation. Operating temperature windows must balance tritium extraction rates against permeation barrier requirements and wall temperature control to prevent cold traps. FREDA couples plasma flux → retention → surface temperature → tritium permeation through walls, and neutronics → tritium breeding ratio → net retention in slag and structures → blanket temperature → tritium concentration gradients.

**Thermal and Mechanical Coupling**
  Radiation-induced swelling and cracking combined with variable heat flux produce mechanical mismatch between layers (W/Cu, SiC/steel, coating/substrate). Cracking or delamination exposes new surfaces, changing erosion and impurity influx, or causing coolant leaks. Understanding thermo-mechanical fatigue under realistic load cycling is essential for availability predictions.

Project Organization
--------------------

FREDA brings together expertise from multiple national laboratories, universities, and industry partners:

* **ORNL Fusion Energy Division**: Core plasma modeling, edge/SOL physics, systems integration
* **ORNL Nuclear Energy and Fuel Cycle Division**: Neutronics, tritium transport, blanket analysis
* **Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory**: Edge physics modeling, BOUT++ development
* **General Atomics**: Pedestal physics, validation
* **UC San Diego**: Core turbulence modeling
* **ORNL Computer Science & Mathematics Division**: Framework development, workflow optimization, uncertainty quantification
* **Sandia National Laboratories**: Advanced optimization methods, UQ infrastructure

The project is funded through both FES and ASCR programs, reflecting
its dual focus on fusion physics and advanced computing methodologies.

Philosophy: Orchestration, Not Full Automation
----------------------------------------------

FREDA's goal is not complete automation but rather **orchestrated,
traceable workflows** that:

* Handle geometry and data translation automatically (plasma flux → wall heat-flux maps → CFD meshes → neutronics)
* Maintain rigorous provenance tracking (code versions, inputs, assumptions)
* Automate parameter scans, UQ, and sensitivity analysis
* Use standardized APIs enabling reproduction and extension without domain expertise in every code
* Reduce bottlenecks so experts can focus on interpretation rather than tedious file handling

Most physics and engineering codes require expert judgment for setup,
boundary assumptions, calibration, convergence assessment, and
interpretation. Forcing complete automation risks "garbage in →
garbage out" scenarios. FREDA instead enables experts to work more
efficiently within a well-structured, reproducible framework.

Contributing to FREDA
---------------------

FREDA is designed as an extensible framework welcoming contributions
from the fusion community. Whether you are developing new physics
models, engineering analysis capabilities, or improved workflow tools,
the FREDA architecture provides standardized interfaces for
integration. The project maintains open documentation, code
repositories, and regular community workshops to facilitate
collaboration.
