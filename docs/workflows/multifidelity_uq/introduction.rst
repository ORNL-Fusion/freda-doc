Multi-Fidelity Uncertainty Quantification for Fusion Reactor Design and
Assessment

Luis, Mike, JM, Chris, Cami

This tasks seeks to improve the design and assessment of fusion reactors by
leveraging multi-fidelity uncertainty quantification (UQ) techniques. By
employing models of varying fidelity, we can gain a more comprehensive
understanding of the complex interactions within fusion systems.

To illustrate the advantages of the multi-fidelity UQ workflow, we present
multiple case studies.
